<h1>Cranny</h1>
<p>Cranny is a digital journal on Android OS that allows the user to keep track of their library so they can archive current and past books they've read. Users can share their most recently read books with friends, including pages read and when they finish a book.</p>

<h3>Current Status of Development</h3>
<p>Cranny is still in the development phase. We are polishing up the visuals and keeping the library usability clean. We are also adding notifications and sharing.</p>

<h3>What We've Learned and Challenges Faced</h3>
<p>During the first month of development, we learned to use Kotlin and Android Studio for app development, designed activity layouts to be respective to their layouts, and utilized Android Studio's resources available for developers. Initially, learning Kotlin syntax was a challenge. Using git with a team for the first time created some merge issues, but we were able to resolve them as a team.</p>

<h3>Features Developed by Each Team Member</h3>
<ul>
<li><u>Will</u>: created the settings page, which can turn on and off notifications and change the user's username. Also updated the delete and clear library functions to include a warning and reflect actions in firebase.</li>
<li><u>Krista</u>: developed the library activity, which generates a list of books in the user's library in a scrollable view. Also created the add book activity, where users can input specific information about a book to add it to their library and save it to the firebase database.</li>
<li><u>Robert</u>: designed the drawer base activity and main drawer menu layout, which allow users to navigate to various activities, including social, library, add a book, favorites, sort by, genre, rating, and tag.</li>
<li><u>Ethan</u>: created the social page, which features a feed to see the user's recently read books and profile information. Also developed the login page using Firebase's Google authentication and classes for CRUD on Firebase.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>The Cranny app is still in development, and there is no installation or setup guide available at this time. However, you can view the progress of our project on GitHub.</p>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>We would like to thank <u>Austin Cordle</u> for his guidance and support during the development of the Cranny app.</p>
